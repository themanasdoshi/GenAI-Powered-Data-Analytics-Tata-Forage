# Tata iQ: GenAI-Powered Credit Risk Analytics

  

## 📄 Project Overview

This repository documents my work as an **AI Transformation Consultant** for **Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ)**. In this simulation, I utilized Generative AI tools to enhance the data analytics lifecycle—from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predictive modeling and strategic implementation.

The project focuses on **Geldium**, a financial client, to predict customer delinquency and optimize collection strategies using ethical AI frameworks.

## 💼 Business Scenario

**Client:** Geldium (Financial Services)
**Problem:** The client is facing challenges with loan delinquency and requires a robust system to identify at-risk customers early.
**Objective:**

1.  Analyze customer data to uncover risk factors.
2.  Build a predictive model to forecast delinquency.
3.  Design an AI-driven, ethical collections strategy to improve recovery rates while ensuring fair customer treatment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

  * **Generative AI:** ChatGPT / Gemini (Used for code generation, synthetic data creation, and strategy formulation).
  * **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas), Data Cleaning, Risk Profiling.
  * **Modeling:** Predictive Analytics (Decision Trees/Logistic Regression logic), Model Evaluation.
  * **Strategy:** Business Intelligence, Ethical AI Guardrails, Agentic AI Design.

## 📂 Project Modules

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Risk Profiling

**Objective:** Assess data quality and identify key indicators of delinquency.

  * Utilized GenAI to automate data summarization and identify anomalies.
  * Addressed missing values and data integrity issues.
  * **Synthetic Data:** Leveraged GenAI to generate synthetic datasets to balance the data and enhance model training scenarios where real data was insufficient.
  * **Outcome:** A comprehensive Data Quality & Risk Profile document.

### Task 2: Predicting Delinquency with AI

**Objective:** Design a logic-based predictive model to flag high-risk customers.

  * Generated model architecture using GenAI prompts (e.g., Random Forest vs. Logistic Regression).
  * Defined evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) to ensure the model captures actual delinquents without excessive false positives.
  * **Outcome:** A predictive modeling framework with a plan for accuracy testing and bias mitigation.

### Task 3: Business Storytelling & Reporting

**Objective:** Translate technical findings into a strategic report for the Head of Collections.

  * Synthesized model outputs into a 2-page executive summary.
  * Highlighted key risk factors (e.g., payment history, debt-to-income ratio).
  * Proposed actionable intervention strategies for at-risk segments.
  * **Outcome:** Stakeholder-ready Business Report emphasizing "Ethical AI" in financial decisions.

### Task 4: AI-Driven Collections Strategy

**Objective:** Design an autonomous, "Agentic AI" system for debt management.

  * Designed a framework where AI agents categorize customers based on risk and sentiment.
  * Established **Guardrails**: Ensuring the AI adheres to financial regulations and treats vulnerable customers fairly.
  * **Outcome:** A strategic roadmap for implementing an automated, empathetic collections system.

## 🚀 Key Insights & Strategy

  * **Risk Factors:** The analysis identified that *[Insert specific finding, e.g., late payment frequency]* is the strongest predictor of future delinquency.
  * **Ethical AI:** The proposed model strictly excludes protected attributes (race, gender) to prevent algorithmic bias, focusing solely on behavioral financial data.
  * **Agentic Approach:** The new strategy moves from static calls to dynamic, AI-personalized communication channels (SMS vs. Email) based on customer responsiveness.
